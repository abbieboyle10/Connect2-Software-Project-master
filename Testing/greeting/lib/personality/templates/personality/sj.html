                        Beavers are hard working and pride
                        themselves on their loyalty and dependability. Beavers have natural talent in managing goods and
                        services--from supervision to maintenance and supply -- and they use all their skills to keep
                        things running smoothly
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Beavers are traditionalists who like structure, routine, and security. They strive to be
                        organised and systematic. Beavers have the ability to take charge and are extremely responsible.

                You are a beaver. Beavers can be described as industrious, methodical, organised, responsible and group
                oriented. If there’s a job
                to be done, beavers can be counted on to put their shoulder to the wheel. People who share this
                temperament tend to take a practical and decisive approach. Beavers
                generally prefer their activities to be clearly defined and like to structure their time and efforts.
                They are are concerned citizens who trust authority, join groups, seek security, prize
                gratitude, and dream of meting out justice. Practical and down-to-earth, beavers believe in following
                the rules and cooperating with
                others. They are not very comfortable winging it or blazing new trails; working steadily within
                the system is the beaver way, for in the long run loyalty, discipline, and teamwork get the job
                done right

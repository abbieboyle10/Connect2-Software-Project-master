                        <br>

                        Elephants generally strive to understand themselves and others, using a personal approach for
                        evaluating information and making decisions. They are gifted teachers and are interested in
                        helping others grow and reach their potential.

                You are an elephant. Elephants can be described as sensitive, caring, thoughtful and diplomatic.
                They have a phenomenal capacity for working with people and drawing out their best. Elephants are the
                idealists of life and tend to serve causes that advance human interests. Thought to be in their own
                world, elephants are caring, thoughtful and are always seeking personal development. They often seek
                uniqueness, freedom, and novelty, which is why many elephants are found in creative careers. At work,
                their differences can be seen in their desirability to work with others.
